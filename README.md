# Making my PortFolio website

Welcome to my project to develop my Portfolio

## What I did :

* A website in HTML, CSS and JS that allows me to introduce myself, to show my skills, my projects and also to be able to contact me.
* A working navbar, some animations and a responsive website for every screens. Also the contact part is half working : informations are sent to my Database.
* An admin part with a fonctionnal CRUD 

## What I did not :
* I would to add a discord bot but for now not. He can send me notifications when someone want to contact me.
* A panel that will allow me to connect at admin and secure my website.

## To be improved :
* Some aspects of the CRUD : improve the aspects and the responsive
* Add few dynamics things like functions in PHP that permits to make easier the dev.
